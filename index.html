                  Taking responsibility - practicing 100 percent responsibility
                  every day - is about seeing ourselves not as right or wrong,
                  but as an agent, chooser, problem solver, and learner in the
                  complex interrelationships of our lives so that we can better
                  integrate with the people and world around us. Use this
                  platform to share inspiring quotes for friends and family.

                <p class="theme">
                  We have three roles here on earth: to learn, to love, and to
                  live. When we stop learning, we start to stagnate and die.
                  When we stop loving, we lose our sense of purpose and become
                  self-centered. When we limit our living, we deny the world the
                  benefits of our talents. Get reminded of how much God loves
                  you and learn new quotes likewise.

                  The foundation stones of honesty, character, faith, integrity,
                  love, and loyalty are necessary for a balanced success that
                  includes health, wealth, and happiness. As you go onward and
                  upward in life, you will discover that if you compromise any
                  of these principles you will end up with only a beggar's
